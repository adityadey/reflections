1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A) When we would like to share our work with other collaborators in a public platform then the remote repository is useful.

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A) If we are working over a feature in the working directory and git automatically pulls up changes, all the work will be lost.

3) Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A) Forks are the cloning of repositories on github.
   Clones are the cloning of repositories on local as well as github to local.
   Branches are the cloning of data from the master node.

4) What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
A) The benefit is that even when we are offline, we can update and make changes to the file and update them back to remote server once we go online.

5) How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
A) It would be harder to see the changes if the codes are collaborated without Git or GitHub.

6) When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
A) Whenever I want to experiment a new feature withiut directly affecting the master branch. It doesnt affect the workflow of the stable version of the software which is available to public inspite of us working on a side version or a new feature.
